## Who am I?

I am Mikey O'Toole ([@homotechsual](https://github.com/homotechsual)) the founder and director for a UK-based managed IT services provider with a passion for automation and good quality MSP software tools.

## What is this?

This is the code for a [PowerShell](https://microsoft.com/powershell) module for the [NinjaOne](https://NinjaOne.com/) platform.

From version 2.0.0-beta1 this module is compatible with PowerShell 7 (aka PowerShell) and PowerShell 5.1 (aka Windows PowerShell).

This module is licensed under the [MIT](https://mit.license.homotechsual.dev/) license.

## What does it do?

NinjaOne provides a PowerShell wrapper around the NinjaOne API. The module can retrieve and send information to the NinjaOne API.

## Thanks & Credits

This module would not work nearly as well without the support of the NinjaOne team in particular:

- Robert K
- Peter B
- Jonathan C
- Kevin O
- Steven M

## Getting Started

The [module documentation](https://docs.homotechsual.dev/modules/ninjaone/) contains all the information you need to get started with the module, contribute improvements and a comprehensive commandlet reference guide.
